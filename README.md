# Web-Scraped Tweet Timemap Analysis

The project writeup can be found [here](documentation/documentation.pdf).

### Project Description
This project focuses on the collection and analysis of web-linked resources (URIs) shared through tweets, specifically around social movements. By scraping tweets that discuss key topics related to movements such as climate change, racial justice, and gender equality, this project aims to examine how well the linked content (often news articles, studies, or other online resources) is preserved over time. The study specifically tracks how these web resources are archived using web mementos (time snapshots), assessing the availability and longevity of these crucial records in the digital archive.

### Background
Social movements often generate significant discourse and media coverage on social platforms like Twitter. With the rapid evolution of technology and the speed at which digital content is created, much of the information shared online can easily be lost, altered, or forgotten over time. The preservation of this information is critical not only for historical analysis but also for legal and social purposes. As technology advances, there is a growing need for the systematic archiving of web content to ensure that digital heritage is maintained. Organizations, including governmental bodies, educational institutions, and private entities, have growing obligations to ensure that their digital records are kept accessible for future generations, for use in research, policy-making, and legal contexts.

### Motivation
The motivation behind this project lies in the increasing importance of digital preservation for societal understanding. With the vast amount of data being generated, it is crucial to assess how effectively online content is preserved for future reference. By analyzing the longevity of linked content within tweets related to social movements, this project seeks to understand how well past online discussions are retained. The potential loss of archived web materials could lead to gaps in understanding social change, political shifts, and technological impacts on society. In particular, archived web materials serve essential functions in areas such as historical research, legal proceedings, and cultural preservation. This project aims to contribute to the broader effort to safeguard our digital history and ensure that pivotal social discussions remain accessible in the future.

### Project Summary and Objectives

This project is structured into four key phases:

1. Tweet Collection: Gather tweets related to social movements through web scraping.
2. URI Extraction: Identify and extract URIs embedded within the collected tweets.
3. Timemap Retrieval: Use MemGator to obtain timemaps (lists of mementos) for each extracted URI.
4. Memento Analysis: Analyze the mementos to uncover patterns in the preservation of digital resources associated with social movements.
